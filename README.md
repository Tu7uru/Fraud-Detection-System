## Introduction

This project is about conducting a evaluation to assess the effectiveness and performance of a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, with the objective of accurately detecting instances of fraud within a given dataset.

For more information see the presentation and the final report within the `/doc` folder.

## Files

Within the `/doc` folder there are 2 pdf files:

- `Fraud_Detection_Report.pdf`: The final report
- `Fraud_Detection_Presentation.pdf`: A small presentation of the project

The `Fraud_Detection_Report.pdf` serves as the comprehensive final report, detailing the procedures employed and presenting the obtained results. On the other hand, the `Fraud_Detection_Presentation.pdf` provides a concise presentation encompassing the algorithms utilized, the methodologies employed, and the final results achieved.

Within the `/src` folder there are 2 jupyter notebook files:

- `Fraud-Detection-System.ipynb`
- `Abstract-Fraud-Detection.ipynb`

The `Fraud-Detection-System.ipynb` is the setup and execute version. The required datasets are mentioned in the `/doc/Fraud_Detection_Report.pdf` file. After downloading the necessary datasets and creating the appropriate environment, the system can be executed as is. Alternatively, the `Abstract-Fraud-Detection.ipynb` file offers a generic version of `Fraud-Detection-System.ipynb`. In the abstract version, variables and parameters have been replaced with comments, allowing the user to test the system on different datasets.
